## Introduction
This project hit home for us and was inspired based on Simon's experiences living with his grandma. Simon's grandmother is 85 years old and is cared for by him, his parents and his siblings. Due to her age and medical conditions, someone always has to be home to take care of her, but even that does not ensure immediate response like last year when she fell in the bathroom and neither him nor his family knew for an hour. This is what HealthSync aims to solve. A portable, easy to use device so that family members can be immediately alerted when their elderly family members get injured or have a medical emergency so that this never happens again.
